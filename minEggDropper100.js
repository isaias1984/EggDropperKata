/** Basic Difficulty */

/* I realized that no matters how many eggs you have. Assuming the premise: "The eggs are all incredibly 
similar â€“ the effect of a fall from a particular floor is the same for all eggs." And assuming the premise: 
"If an egg does not survive a fall from floor n, then it would also not survive a fall from the floors above 
it: floor n+1, floor n+2, etc." too. The critical floor is the floor below where I droop the egg and it breaks. 
Doesn't matter how many eggs I have because if one breaks I don't need the rest because the rest breaks too.*/
